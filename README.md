# Solution of a singly Linked List that is used for 32 bit Integer data

## The Linked List methods:
- addFirst(e) -> adds element e to the front of the linked list
- addLast(e) -> adds element e to the end of the linked list,
- removeLast() -> remove element e from the end of the linkedlist
- removeFirst() -> remove element e from the front of the linkedlist
- getFirst() -> return the first element in the linkedlist l, or NULL if the list is empty
- getLast() -> return the last element in the linkedlist l, or NULL if the list is empty
- showList() -> print a string representation of the linkedlist l to the stdout
- reverse() -> reverse the linked list
- toString() -> override method to return the string version of linked list

## Instructions:
- The linked list solution is in LinkedList.java file, it is a class so can be used for creating objects
- The Main.java file is used for testing
- To run the files, run "javac *.java" then "java Main"

## For testing in Main.java:
- The testing was created manually not via any framework due to set up issues
- The test is basically from the Testing method that compare the actual result to the expected result
- To create your own test, only need to call Testing method and pass in it 2 strings: the actual result that you want to compare and the expected result
